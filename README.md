# QA Test Design – Open Bank Project (OBP)

This repository is a **mini QA project** built to learn, practice and demonstrate
**test design for APIs** using the [Open Bank Project (OBP) Sandbox](https://openbankproject.com/).

## 📌 Objectives
- Practice **manual end-to-end testing** of REST APIs.
- Apply **test design techniques**: user stories, risk analysis, NFRs, traceability.
- Organize tests and evidence in a **structured QA repository**.
- Show that test design is **not a “seven-headed beast”**, but a clear and systematic process.

## 🗂 Repository structure
/docs
/user-stories/ → functional user stories (US-001, US-002…)
/test-design/ → manual test cases, strategies
/test-nfr/ → non-functional test definitions
/test-risk/ → risk analysis for each US
/test-trace/ → traceability matrices

📖 Why this project?
Because QA is not just about clicking buttons.
It’s about thinking systematically: understanding requirements, identifying risks, designing tests, and proving coverage.
This mini project shows how to:
Transform requirements → ACs → test cases
Cover functional + non-functional aspects
Track evidence and coverage with traceability
