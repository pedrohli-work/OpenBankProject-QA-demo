# Open Bank Project(OBP) - QA API Demo

This repository is a **mini QA project** built to learn, practice and demonstrate Quality Assurance Engineering for APIs 
using the [Open Bank Project (OBP) Sandbox](https://openbankproject.com/).

## 📌 Objectives
- Practice **manual end-to-end testing** of REST APIs.
- Apply **test design techniques**: user stories, risk analysis, NFRs, traceability.
- Organize tests and evidence in a **structured QA repository**.
- Show that test design is **not a “seven-headed beast”**, but a clear and systematic process.

## 🗂 Repository structure
- docs
- user-stories/ → functional user stories (US-001, US-002…)
- test-design/ → manual test cases, strategies
- test-nfr/ → non-functional test definitions
- test-risk/ → risk analysis for each US
- test-trace/ → traceability matrices

📖 Why this project?

Because QA is not just about clicking buttons.  
It’s about thinking systematically:  

- Understanding requirements  
- Identifying risks  
- Designing tests  
- Proving coverage  

This mini project shows how to:  
- Transform requirements → ACs → test cases  
- Cover functional + non-functional aspects  
- Track evidence and coverage with traceability
